-- GAMEWORLD - SETTING --
The game is inspired by the successful TV-series "Supernatural".
The timeline of the story emerges when both brothers are very young. Dean is a little kid (7-8) and Sam is a newborn. Father is out hunting and left you (Dean) as the man of the house. He is late, but that is nothing new for you. Action begins when creatures of "Supernatural" 's culture start to break through into the house. They want Sam. His baby room is to the right side of the Level. The door they emerge from, to the left. You start with some defensive items that you can place on the floor (Plants vs Zombies alike) that will help you defeat them.

-- THE PHILOSOPHY --
Must save Sam tries to blend classic RPG game elements with a tower defense game. The key to achieve such thing, is the player to be represented into the game by a sprite and not just clicking to perform actions. That way, the player not only has to defend his brother but also himself. The actions he can take are limited to the space around him, so, i.e. he canâ€™t just click anywhere and place an item.  The game takes advantage of various aspects of an RPG, like leveling, crafting etc.

-- GAMEPLAY --
Gameplay will have two main stages.

1. Creature Waves (core gameplay)
    Each wave will get more difficult.
2. Preparation Stage
    After each Wave - or a set number of Waves - the player will be able to create Defensive Items to use in the next Wave(s). A basic         upgrade/crafting panel will be implemented.

-- FEATURE SET --
1. Dean is a movable sprite and can place defensive items to all directions, one grid square next to him.
2. Gather resources to craft new items or upgrade existing ones (preparetion stage)
3. Assing defensive items on your skillbar. That can only be done when preparing for the next wave. Choose wisely!
4. Fear: Instead of Health, Dean has a Fear-o-meter. As he gets close to the monsters his Fear level goes up. Fear thresholds and the      negative effects of each, will be defined later.
   (for sure, when Fear is at maximum level, Dean won't be able to move, but only place items where he stands, thus making it almost        impossible to defend his brother. He will be able to set free using a "Fear reduction potion")
6. Essense: Essense emerges from Creatures Dean kills and automatically collects it. Dean uses that Essense on the preparation stage to craft items. The essense Dean is able to collect is not infinite and has a number size restriction. Dean can level up that number and be able to hold more essense. This is a crucial game concept and cannot easily be ignored.
7. Level up your Hero stats. Choose to increase your Fear-o-meter or your Essense limits.

-- CREATURES -- 
Each creature moves forward on its lane towards baby Sam's room (all creatures' ultimate goal). Each class of creature has its own speed, health, level and "Fear emission". Fear emission is calculated per second, when the player is inside the Fear emission FIELD of the creature. Each creature has its own radius of emission. Creatures also have a unique ability/skill. For example, Vampyrs can heal an adjusted fellow creature. 
A variety of Creatures, each with its own weaknesses, strengths and skills, will be later described in detail.
